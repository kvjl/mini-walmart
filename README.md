# Mini Walmart

Mini Walmart is a simple React project I built as a quick experiment in building a basic product list interface and UI logic.

The idea was to play around with React component structure, passing props, and rendering a dynamic list of items — kind of like a tiny, pared-down version of a shopping/catalog UI.

## What This Project Does

- Displays a list of products
- Shows basic product details (name, price, etc.)
- Demonstrates simple React component hierarchy
- Uses basic state/prop interactions for rendering

## Why I Built It

Mostly as a hands-on way to deepen my React fundamentals:

- Practicing component composition
- Rendering lists dynamically
- Working with props and simple state
- Getting comfortable with project structure in React

It’s intentionally lightweight and exploratory, not a full ecommerce clone.

## Tech Stack

- React  
- Vite  
- JavaScript  
- Basic CSS for layout

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
